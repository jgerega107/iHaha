The final frontier of social media apps.

# Story
So here it is, my unfinished vision for the perfect social media app, which originally started as a way to leave the constantly changing (and quite annoying) UI of Snapchat.

This application initially started as a joke by one of my best friends and then expanded into one of the most ambitious projects I have ever done, pretty much entirely by myself. The project slowly began to morph into the final project submission for my high school android mobile app development class. Once I graduated, the project went even further beyond. I am quite proud of this work, even though the quality of some of the code will show, as this was made quite early in my CS career.

This repo will probably be archived, as I do not want to touch the state of this repository. Messing with imports could break anything and I really don't have the time to deal with puttting everything back together.  

# Running
You can clone the repository and set up a brand new Firebase project to see the project in action, or you can use one of my prebuilt APKs to join my network. Add me and send me a message @jgerega107 !

If you are still interested in building, clone the repository and follow these directions:

If you are interested in helping me out with the future of iHaha, feel free to help contribute to my newer project, openchat, based on the Flutter framework.

# My vision
Originally, I wanted to first incorporate the common features that many social media applications include, such as:
* Read notifications
* See active chat participant
* Some way to alter photos taken (Drawing??? Stickers???)

Getting into the more ambitious features:
* Desktop client/Web client (Could probably have been done with flutter? CONTRIBUTE TO OPENCHAT)
* VR Client (kinda started as a joke inspired by the incredibles movie, could have been a gamechanger ps hire me oculus)
* ???

There are definetly things that I recognize that could have been done way better. For instance, when I was designing this application, camera access was a particularly tricky subject. There were a few camera libraries that I had the opportunity to use (which I did) and CameraX was just announced as an alpha library at Google I/O. My notification function that I deployed to Firebase could probably have been done better, as that was one of my only endeavors into JS until I started studying in college. There would definetly need to be a stability pass as the networking features of the app can seem quite sluggish at times. Notifications do not actually make a ring and do not present themselves as a notification over other apps. 

There are countless other things that needed refinement but was still satisfying to get to function nonetheless.

Thanks for reading!
